hello! this is an improved layout for programmers or for those who often use brackets, when I started programming I faced a problem, when I click on the brackets with the little finger of my right hand over time I started to notice some pain and great inconvenience, but when I created a script for linux (.kmap) I hope to finally feel comfortable. Now I rely on the community to extend this or similar layouts to other operating systems, such as freebsd or windows.
thank you very much OJ Bucao!
